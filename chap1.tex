\chapter{Introduction}
Story: 
1. The paradigm of real-world robot manipulation now: end effector for interaction + collision-free motion planning for the arm.
2. This is not how humans do it. Humans make contact-rich interactions. 
3. Scaling things down a bit, contact-rich manipulation also includes dexterous manipulation. 

4. But why is contact-rich manipulation so hard? Local minima and the explosion of the number of contact modes. 


Perhaps the most succesful real-wrold application of robotic manipulation divides the robot into two parts: an end effector that accounts for a tiny part of the robot but is responsible for making all the interactions with the world, and an arm that constitutes the bulk of the robot but painstakingly avoids interactions with the world by collision-free motion planning.

This is in stark constrast with how humans use their arms.
